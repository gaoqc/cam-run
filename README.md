# Webcam Runner

A running game based on webcam, controlling the game character in an infinite scene by detecting user movements. **Now with AI Companion** providing real-time movement guidance and personalized feedback. Main technologies: Three.js, MediaPipe Pose

## Technical Architecture

### Core Frameworks
- **Three.js**: For 3D scene rendering
  - Infinite terrain generation
  - Scene object handling
  - Camera animation management
- **MediaPipe Pose**: For motion detection
  - Supports full-body/half-body recognition
  - Real-time pose estimation 
  - Keypoint tracking
  - User distance detection (supports close-range mode)
  - Movement intensity calculation (based on user weight)

## Features
